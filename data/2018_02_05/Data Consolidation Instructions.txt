Instructions for Consolidating TactileTTS Study Data

1. Download both phases from Qualtrics as an SPSS file with extra long string widths (More Options).
2. Copy downloaded files to appropriate location (Dropbox) and rename to something friendly.
3. For Phase1 file, delete fields 3-17
4. For Phase1 file, delete field 53
5 Change data type for P1ParticipantGroup and P1ParticipantTrial to Numeric (1,0)
6. For Phase1 file, prepend (P1) to fields 1,2,51,52
7. For Phase2 file, delete fields 3-17
8. For Phase2 file, delete field 39,40,41
9. For Phase2 file, prepend "P2" to fields 1,2,37,38
10 Change data type for P2ParticipantGroup and P2ParticipantTrial to Numeric (1,0)
11. Open Phase1 dataset in SPSS, sort by GUID, and delete duplicates
12. Open Phase2 dataset in SPSS and sort by GUID, and delete duplicates
13. Data -> Merge Files -> Add Variables -> From An Open Dataset -> <Phase2file> -> One-to-One merge based on key values (participantGuid should be listed in the Key Variables box)
14. Save result into a new file (e.g., TactileTTSMerged.sav)
15. Download Phase 2 data file as a tab-delimited file (using the new exporter, not legacy)
16. Open TSV in Excel, delete all fields except GUID and resultstring
17. Change order of fields to be GUI and then resultstring
18. Sort by GUID, and delete duplicates, save as TSV (this is the input file for Luke's script)
19. Run skippers script and output all desired datasets.
20. Import CSV navdata file into a new SPSS data file.
21. Merge NavData.sav in the same way (this file is processed via Luke's script)
22. Run recode.sps ONCE. This syntax file does the following:
	a. Reverse-codes MSLQ33SR_2 MSLQ57SR_2 MSLQ37ER_2 MSLQ60ER_2
	b. Computes variables(I,TA,RE,SR,ER,PreTest,PostTest)
	c. Computes Skippers by flagging those ParticipantGuids that are in the list
