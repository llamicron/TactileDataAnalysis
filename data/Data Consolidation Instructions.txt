Instructions for Consolidating TactileTTS Study Data

1. Download both phases from Qualtrics as an SPSS file with extra long string widths (More Options).
2. Copy downloaded files to appropriate location (Dropbox) and rename to something friendly.
3. Open Phase1 dataset in SPSS and sort by GUID
4. Open Phase2 dataset in SPSS and sort by GUID
5. For Phase1 file, delete fields 3-17
6. For Phase1 file, delete field 53
7. For Phase1 file, prepend (P1) to fields 1,2,51,52
8. For Phase2 file, delete fields 3-17
9. For Phase2 file, delete field 39,40,41
10. For Phase2 file, prepend "P2" to fields 1,2,35,37,38
11. Data -> Merge Files -> Add Variables -> From An Open Dataset -> <Phase2file> -> One-to-One merge based on key values (participantGuid should be listed in the Key Variables box)
12. Save result into a new file (e.g., TactileTTSMerged.sav)
13. Merge NavData.sav in the same way (this file is processed via Luke's script)
14. Run recode.sps ONCE. This syntax file does the following:
	a. Reverse-codes MSLQ33SR_2 MSLQ57SR_2 MSLQ37ER_2 MSLQ60ER_2
	b. Computes variables(I,TA,RE,SR,ER,PreTest,PostTest)
	c. Computes Skippers by flagging those ParticipantGuids that are in the list
